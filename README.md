## More about me (Questionnaire)

Hello, my name is Edzhem.<br>


I have a Bachelor in Information Technology from University of Economics - Varna, but no previous professional experience.<br>
I have studied C++, Java, C#, JS, Php, SQL, but Python is the programming language I am most familiar with.<br>
I also passed a Php Fundamentals course and recently started an intensive Python course.<br>
There is not a programming language that I do not want to prctice, but definitely I can say that C# is too complex/confusing for me due to difficult syntax.<br>
Nevetheless I am very motivated and willing to learn and develop.<bg>
Thank you for your time spent reading my CV. I appreciate the opportunity to meer with you.
